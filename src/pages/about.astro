  <p>
	Hello! I'm Henry, a passionate developer and lifelong learner. I created this blog to share my journey in technology, programming, and digital creativity. Here you'll find tutorials, thoughts on the latest in AI, and stories from my experience building projects and exploring new tools.
  </p>
  <p>
	My background spans web development, automation, and creative coding. I enjoy experimenting with new frameworks, writing about my discoveries, and helping others grow their skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, I hope you'll find something useful and inspiring here.
  </p>
  <p>
	When I'm not coding, you might find me reading, hiking, or tinkering with side projects. If you have questions, feedback, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
