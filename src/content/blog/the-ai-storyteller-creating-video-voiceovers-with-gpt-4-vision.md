OpenAI has just unveiled one of its most significant updates, making their models cheaper, faster, and more extensive than ever. This update introduces "Banner Control" for function calling and larger language model outputs. These improvements promise to open up new possibilities for developing exciting AI-driven applications.

Within just 24 hours of the release, developers and enthusiasts worldwide have begun experimenting with these enhanced capabilities. From analyzing website landing pages to generating video voiceovers, the potential applications are boundless. In this blog post, we'll explore one fascinating application where you can create video voiceovers using GPT-4V.

## The Video Voiceover Generator

To create the video voiceover generator, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Set up the Environment:** Start by creating a project in a code editor, like Visual Studio Code. You'll need to add your OpenAI API key in an environment variable.
2. **Video to Frames:** The first function, "video to frames," takes the uploaded video, converts it into individual frames, and calculates the video's duration. This information is essential for generating a voiceover of an appropriate length.
3. **Frames to Stories:** This function converts the image frames into a coherent script based on a user-provided prompt. It breaks down the frames into smaller groups (typically 25 frames per group) and sends them to GPT-4V for generating a story.
4. **Text to Audio:** Once you have the script, you can convert it into a voiceover using OpenAI's text-to-speech model. This function generates an audio file from the generated text.
5. **Merge Audio and Video:** The final step is to combine the audio and video files to create the video with the generated voiceover.
6. **Main Function:** This step is mainly to properly set the prompt and duration, also manage the temp files.
7. **Run Streamlit:**

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

### Using the Video Voiceover Generator

To use the video voiceover generator, follow these steps:

1. Upload a short video clip of your choice.
2. Provide a prompt for the voiceover. The default prompt suggests creating a short voiceover script for the video.
3. Click the "Generate" button.

The generator will process the video, create a script based on the prompt, generate a voiceover, and merge it with the video. The resulting video will feature the voiceover, effectively narrating the content in the video.

## Real-World Applications

The possibilities with the video voiceover generator are intriguing. It can be used for a range of applications, from creating educational content and tutorials to enhancing marketing videos or even for generating humorous voiceovers for fun.

Beyond video voiceovers, OpenAI's GPT-4V and related tools offer a wide array of opportunities for developers to build unique and innovative applications. The ability to blend different modalities, such as text, images, and audio, opens up new dimensions in AI-powered creativity.

As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more imaginative and practical applications emerge. From automatic website analysis to interactive website hacking assistants, the potential for AI-driven solutions is limitless.

In conclusion, OpenAI's GPT-4V and its related models are unleashing a new wave of creative and practical applications that blend various modalities. The video voiceover generator is just one exciting example of what's possible. With this powerful AI at our fingertips, we're on the cusp of a new era of innovation and automation. The future is looking more fascinating than ever.
